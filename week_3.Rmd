#### 4.4 Practice

 1. Why does this code not work?
 
```{r}
my_variable <- 10
my_varıable
```

This code doesn't work becuase in the second line, the character i in my_varıable doesn't match the character i in the first line. 

 2. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:
 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl == 8)
filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
```

 3. Press Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?

It takes you to a menu with keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard shortcuts can also be found under tools in the menu.
